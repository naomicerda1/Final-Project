                <p>Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is an autoimmune bleeding disorder. The disorder causes the immune system to destroy platelets that the body needs in order for normal blood clotting to occur.</p>
                <ul>
                    <p>Symptoms</p>
                    <li><b>Purpura</b>: Purple color of the skin after blod is under the skin. In other words, bruising. Often the appear for unknown reasons or when one barely hurts themselves it shows as if there was major trauma to the body.</li>
                    <li><b>Petechia</b>: Tiny red dots under the skin that are a result of a very small bleed.</li>
                    <li><b>Nosebleeds</b></li>
                    <li><b>Bleeding in the mouth and gums</b></li>
                    <li><b>Bleeding in the head</b>: Head bump or any head injury can be dangerous because one might not have enough platelets to stop bleeding.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>There are unfortunately 2 types of the autoimmune disease. There's <i>Acute Thrombocytopenic Purpura</i> and <i>Chronic Thrombocytopenic Purpura</i>. Acute ITP is more common among us humans but is mostly found in children from two to six years old.
                    <br><b>Characteristics include:</b>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Chickenpox like symptoms (Viral Illness)</li>
                        <li>Suddenly Onset</li>
                        <li>Symptoms disappear within a few weeks.</li>
                        <li>Treatments is usually not needed because disorder usually disappears</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>Chronic Thrombocytopenic Purpura is more often found in adults.
                    <br><b>Characteristics include:</b>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Can happen at any age!</li>
                        <li>Symptoms vary from a minimum of 6 months to even a lifetime.</li>
                        <li>Woman have a greater chance of developing it than men.</li>
                        <li>ITP can often return and requires various followup with blood specialists.</li>
                    </ol>

                <h2><a id="causes">Causes</a></h2>
                    <p>There's no exact cause to ITP, it's not a contagious disorder. Many Doctors believe a child can develope ITP through a virus or viral infection that they carried on for weeks because the anti-bodies that are fighting the virus accidentally make another anti-body that sticks to the platelet cells. The body then destroys those cells with anti-bodies because they're foreign cells. </p><br>

                    <p>Doctors start off with doing a full physical examination and a complete medical history examination.
                        <br><b>Other Diagnostic Procedures include</b>:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Complete Blood Count</li>
                            <li>Blood & Urine Test Samples</li>

            <section id="Treatments">
                <h2><a id="treatments">Treatments</a></h2>
                    <p>Treatment often depends on the person. For example, the persons age, overall health, medical history, the type of ITP diagnosis, the severity of disorder, tolerance of specific medication, therapies, procedures and even the patients expectations or preferences on the outcome. Not all people with ITP require treatment but Doctors do require close monitoring of the patients platelets so they can prevent any serious bleeding. Doctors tend to try to let the body correct the disorder on it's own when it comes to children. Children tend to recover within six months.
                        <br>If serious treatment is necessary, here are the <b>common forms of treatment:</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Steroids for ITP: Helps prevent bleeding in the form of decreasing the rate of platelet destruction. If effective, patients can see increase in platelet count within 2-3 weeks. <i>Side Effects include irritability, stomach irritation, acne, weight gain and hypertension.</i></li>
                            <li>Intravenous Gamma Globulin (IVGG) for ITP: It works the same as the steroids but patients can see results within 24-48 Hours.</li>
                            <li>Medication/Medication Change</li>
                            <li>Infection Treatment</li>
                            <li>Splenectomy</li>
                            <li>Hormone Therapy</li>
                            <li>Rh Immune Globulin: Temporarily stops spleen from destroying platelets. But before given, patient must be Rh positive and have a spleen in order for medication to work.</li>
                        </ul>
